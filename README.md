# 🧠 Algorithms & Problem Solving — C++ Implementations

This repository contains **C++ solutions** to a collection of algorithmic and problem-solving exercises originally designed as flowcharts. Each problem is implemented in **two ways**:

1. **My Solution** – My own approach to solving the problem.  
2. **Dr. Mohamed Abu-Hadhoud’s Solution** – The reference approach provided by my instructor.

---

## ⚠️ Purpose of This Repository
- Strengthen **algorithmic thinking** and **problem-solving skills**.  
- Compare different approaches to the same problem.  
- Prepare for more complex programming challenges in C++ or other languages.  
- Provide a bridge from **flowchart logic** to **actual code implementation**.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **C++** (compiled with any standard C++ compiler)  
- IDE: Visual Studio / Code::Blocks / any other C++ IDE
